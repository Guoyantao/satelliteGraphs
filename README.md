# satelliteGraphs
R scripts for visualization and analysis of satellite datasets

Example graphical output:

![Example with points colorized by year](LAI over DOY Colorized by Year.png "Example of graphical output from satelliteGraphs with points colorized by year:")

Nonlinear least squares looks pretty linear:
